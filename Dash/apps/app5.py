##### More Data:
In general, machine learning models perform better the more high-quality data they have as inputs. With much 
more data we would likely achieve higher performance from our models, and could even potentially use more 
complicated models. A future path of investigation would be to source more data for our model training. To control 
for changes in the housing market over time, we could use the value of the Case-Schiller HPI to adjust sales prices 
to a reference year of our choosing. This would allow us to use more data while minimizing the error introduced 
by using home sales prices at different points in time.\n
---
##### Domain Knowledge:
To better inform our data processing and feature engineering processes, we really could have used more extensive 
domain knowledge. By interviewing subject matter experts (real estate agents and home inspectors) we could learn 
a lot more about what classes of our features could be grouped together to simplify our dataset. We could also 
generate more, better-informed ideas to try in our feature engineering process.\n
---
##### Home Feature Quality Interactions:
There are multiple features in our dataset that deal with the quality of different home aspects (such as the heating system, exterior materials, kitchen, and basement). While we did overall multicollinearity analysis on our models and investigated the variance inflation factors for each, we did not conduct a correlation analysis specifically on the quality features for home aspects. It would be interesting to see if homes in general are in overall good / overall poor condition, or if homes have a mix of quality ratings. On top of being an interesting analysis, the outcome could help influence future feature engineering work.'''


ml_intercept_text = '''
---
Heating quality and condition (HeatingQC) - Excellent drops to the intercept, other categories in our 
analysis are good, typical, and fair.\n

houses that lack central air.\n

intercept, we have another category for non-standard electrical systems, which includes: \n
(a) Fuse Box over 60 AMP and all Romex wiring, \n

hardboard / other (imitation stucco, asphalt shingles,  precast, and cinderblock), and (b) asbestos shingles.
