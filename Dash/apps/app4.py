clustertext='''### Analysis
This graph gives a better understanding of similar neighborhoods in our Ames dataset. When selecting two clusters, we can see a distinct neighborhood in the mid right. Thats the North Ridge, Stone Bridge area. You can observe based on the Get to know Ames maps that these houses are new and expensive. This is clearly a fancier part of the town, the who's who of Ames, IA, if you will, which is what sets it so apart from other neighborhoods. \n\n
When you increase to three clusters, we see Clear Creek neighborhood stands out in yellow. This neighborhood is interesting because we actually ended up dropping many houses from this neighborhood from our dataset. This was because many of them were more industrial used properties, ie agricultural etc, and were not useful in our model. This distinction is likely why it is set apart in our clustering. \n\n This continues as increasing the cluster numbers, next we see Timbers neighborhood broken out, then BrookDale. Ultimately after feeding these clusters into our stepwise model, we found the most informative was the North Ridge distinction, as it remained non-zero after penalization.

kitchen_text = '''
Kitchens are very expensive to remodel, so if a buyer is looking for an excellent-quality kitchen
it is recommended to purchase a home with one rather than planning to remodel an existing kitchen.
Online sources indicate a midrange kitchen renovation often totals $40,000 - $50,000. Our machine learning model
indicates homes in Ames with excellent kitchens command just a $24,300 premium, so it is cheaper to buy a
home with a high-quality kitchen than to upgrade one post-purchase. Also, it is recommended that sellers
avoid doing full kitchen renovations as it is unlikely they will recoup their investment.
'''

asbestos_text = '''
Asbestos was a widely used house exterior material until the 1970's, when it was banned.
The negative health effects of asbestos are widely known, yet many homes still have their
original asbestos exteriors. It is not a serious health issue until the asbestos becomes cracked and
worn and fibers become airborne, but the shingles will eventually need to be replaced. It is an
expensive process requiring special safety gear and permitting. Our model indicates a $13,400 hit
to home resale value from having asbestos shingles rather than more typical vinyl siding or plywood
covering. The cost to both dispose of the asbestos and replace it with another exterior material is
likely to be significantly higher than this, so we recommend that buyers avoid homes with asbestos
siding and that sellers forego replacing it and sell their home as-is.
'''

bathroom_text = '''
Available online sources indicate that the cost of adding a new bathroom to a home averages $10,000.
Given that our pricing algorithm does not increase in accuracy when including bathroom count,
it is not recommended that sellers add to the bathroom count of their home. It is, however,
recommended that buyers make sure to purchase a home with the number of bathrooms they desire.
Money invested in adding bathrooms after purchase is unlikely to be recouped at a future sale of the home.
'''


remodeled_text = '''
One question we had when reviewing the data was ‘how much value does remodeling add to your resale value’.\n
In an attempt to answer it we decided to split the dataset- one containing the remodeled houses and one containing the unremodeled houses,
and then using regression to explore the difference in coefficients. However, there is a clear confounding factor here, Age.
Older homes are much more likely to have been remodeled. In order to control for this, we selected only houses built within
a year range where there was a strong mixture of remodeled and unremodeled houses. We chose 1950-1999. Houses before 1950 were
mostly 100% remodeled and in this year range, a consistent 30% had been remodeled and 70% were unremodeled. Running two simple regressions on
each dataset to isolate the effect of year built in both the remodeled and unremodeled cases we obtained the following equations:
The Remodeled Houses SLR Equation is:\n
*SalePrice=140,060.3 + 1,913.6 Year After 1950*\n
The Unremodeled Houses SLR Equation is:\n
*SalePrice=117,752.01 + 1,892.37 Year After 1950*\n
We can see there is a clear discrepancy of over $20k in base price for unremodeled versus remodeled houses of the same year.
The effect of house age is slightly different between the two based on the coefficients however much less significantly than
the base prices. We conclude based on this simple model that remodeled houses of the same year are worth about $20k more than
their unremodeled counterparts and age has a similar effect on both groups.
